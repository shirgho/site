Just some [Ball](ball.html "code") from the breakout game, with a ball bouncing around aimlessly.
Reminded me of the TV/Monitor screen savers, when we would also start watching, and will the ball or the company logo of the tv/sat set to hit the corners of the screen.

<pre> <h4> Simple Breakout using just JS, HTML and CSS
14-04-2022 </h4> </pre>

Started following, or refollowing a very simple [Breakout](breakout.html "breakout") clone using just JS, HTML and CSS using the Mozzila Breakout tutorial. The easiest way to upload a game on to a static site. Well, even better would be to use no JS as well.
