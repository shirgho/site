Some more small tunes and stuff uploaded over the past months:

[Yaar](https://youtu.be/QcWIrI5A0bs "Yaar")

For my yaars who need it.

[Kidher Ja rahay hain](https://youtu.be/msTROBQTfqY "Kidher Ja rahay hain")

Did not sing it well, but it's the idea for now.

[Riff Drive](https://youtu.be/h4BABGtDuKo "Riff Drive")

Even though just a simple riff, it fits in well here, because it is kind of a forgettable riff lol, and I probably would forget it and not do anything with it.
Not that I've done anything with it since.

After losing a lot of recording over the years because I destroyed my phone, I've decided to push myself to upload recordings to YouTube instead, and write about them here.

The idea is to upload very rough, uncut ideas of songs or melodies or anything. Over time maybe inspiration strikes and I'll combine the individual ideas, or just let them be.

Don't want to lose them completely though. And kinda makes me happy to upload them, even if they're just for my record.

Listen to the first of the ones [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toNJTKFqprs "Morning A01"). 

Literally a recorded video from my phone I did this morning. Such unstable light. Think all of them will be something like this.

I'll divide this music section of the site into different sections as well, later.

<pre> <h4> The Strokes - Razorblade - Live 2022
14-04-2022 </h4> </pre>

The Strokes go Cumbia during these South America tours, in the middle of Razorblade which was already one of my favourite songs. 

I love the guitar in Razorbalde. The verse sections especially, and I love the improvisations in these live versions. GG.

Also love the solo and Julian's vocals over it, especially when live, even if I never really understand the lyrics.

In the studio version, it's "I loved you, before, I, saw youuuuuuuuu." Something beautiful there. I think he changes it now after the divorce though, haha.

Watch one of the performances, where they keep the solo structure and leave out the autotune [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPWspGwb7JE "Razorblade live").

The [Chile version](https://youtu.be/YSfmJvLpF7U?t=2771 "Razorblade live") goes even heavier on the groove and cumbia melody change, and heavier on Casablanca auto tune style. 

Bonus: The Strokes and the crowd collaborate to make a song over Ole Ole Ole! Right after the Razorblade performance.
