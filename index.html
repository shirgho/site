    <h1> STUFF </h1>

    <section id="start">
      <p>Site where I post ponderings and other stuff, in part to collect and remind myself of the stuff I'm working on, as well as to motivate myself to keep working on said stuff.</p>

    <section id="julia">
      <pre> <h4> Julia - Programming
      11-04-2022 </h4> </pre>
      
      Started getting to know [Julia](introToJulia.html "julia").

      <pre> <h4> Updating the writing section.
      01-04-2022 </h4> </pre>
      
      Have a lot of short stories I want to add, and a lot of meandering kinda
      essays. But for now, just put the two published things, not the better things.

      I feel the rest are too unpolished, but maybe I should just put them here as well, otherwise 
      I'll probably never work on polishing them up. Maybe once they're here, I'll feel more inclined.

    <section id="mdhtmlconversion">
      <pre> <h4> Markdown to Html conversion
    06-04-2022 </h4> </pre> 
      <p>Implemented a small conversion script that uses pandoc to let me write all the site's content in Markdown instead of in HTML directly. 
        The site is quite easy to build and deploy now, without the use of a static site generator, at least, so far, when the content is just mostly text.</p>

       <pre> <h4> Hello World
    28-04-2021 </h4> </pre> 
      
      Hello World people's. This website is just html and css. Will I have to write in html, not even markdown? Will I ever post again?
      Dekhtay hain -- We shall see.
