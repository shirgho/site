    <h1> STUFF </h1>

    <section id="start">
      <p>Site where I post ponderings and other stuff, in part to collect and remind myself of the stuff I'm working on, as well as to motivate myself to keep working on said stuff.</p>

      <pre> <h4> Markdown to Html conversion   06-04-2022 </h4> </pre> 
      <p>Implemented a small conversion script that uses pandoc to let me write all the site's content in Markdown instead of in HTML directly. 
        The site is quite easy to build and deploy now, without the use of a static site generator, at least, so far, when the content is just mostly text.</p>

       <pre> <h4> Hello World    28-04-2021 </h4> </pre> 
      
      Hello World people's. This website is just html and css. Will I have to write in html, not even markdown? Will I ever post again?
      Dekhtay hain -- We shall see.
