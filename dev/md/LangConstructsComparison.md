# Comparison or Easy Look up for Language Constructs

I am, usually, working in different languages during a normal workday.
And despite programming for some time now, every day I forget how to do a simple thing.

It's quite annoying. 

I will try and summarise the common constructs that trip me up, because they are similar enough across most languages, but different enough that they don't compile, or cause unexpected problems.

## Declaring and initialising 
### variables
### arrays

To initialise/declare an empty array:
-----------------------
C++ | JS | Python
-----------------------
 int a[] = {} | a = [] | a = []
 vector<int> a = {} | | |
 list<int> a = {} | |


### objects
Objects are not necessarily instances of classes across languages.
In JS, they are also the fundamental variable/entity, and are
equivilant to dictionaries, hashmaps.
In Python?
In C++, they are an instance of a class, a variable.


## scopes

## Iterating through Loops

### The classic For Loop, with index
#### enemurate in python

### For Each
#### The For Each in JS
#### the key, value in python
#### iterators in c++
