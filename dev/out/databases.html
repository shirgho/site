    <h1 id="databases">Databases</h1>
    <p>Databases. Can't live with them, can't live without them.</p>
    <p>Actually, you can live without them.</p>
    <p>Because, I've basically lived without them, or without actually using them or developing with them.</p>
    <h2 id="what-are-they">What are they</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>A database is basically made up of tables.</li>
    <li>A table is rows (un named) and column (named).</li>
    <li>Data in column is of same type</li>
    <li>Tables can be joined with other tables to function as if they were that large table.</li>
    <li>Rows and Tables can be retrieved by queries on the joined tables.</li>
    <li>Retrieved data from a query can be aggregated, grouped and sorted.</li>
    <li>Rows can be delted, updated and inserted.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="some-terms">Some terms</h2>
    <p>Following this medium article now. Seems like a good overview:</p>
    <p>https://medium.com/<span class="citation">@rwilliams_bv/intro-to-databases-for-people-who-dont-know-a-whole-lot-about-them-a64ae9af712</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Query</li>
    </ul>
    <p>single action taken on a database; a request in a predefined format. Kinda like an api/function call.</p>
    <p>SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</p>
    <p>e.g. SELECT ToolName FROM Wrenches</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Transaction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>a sequence of queries (operations/actions) that make up a single unit of work performed against database.</p>
    <p>e.g. Two UPDATE operations to reduce A's balance by 20 and increase B's balance by 20.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ACID</li>
    </ul>
