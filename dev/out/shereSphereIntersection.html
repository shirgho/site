    <h1 id="sphere-sphere-intersection">Sphere Sphere Intersection</h1>
    <p>The intersection of two spheres would be a circle, or a curve. (The intersection of two circles would be a line.) A nice formulation I found and understood, and one that follows nicely in code as well is:</p>
    <p>We have two spheres, with centres (c_1 and c_2) and radius (r_1 and r_2). We say that their intersection has the centre c_i and r_i.</p>
    <p>First, we check if the spheres are placed in a way that intersection is not logically possible:</p>
    <p>Distance between the spheres: d = ||c_2 - c_1||</p>
    <p>So, if r_1 + r_2 &lt; d, then it cannot possibly be intersecting, as it has some separation between the spheres.</p>
    <p>If r_1 + r_2 == d, then intersection is a single point, c_i = c_1 + (c_2 - c_1) * r_1/d.</p>
    <p>If one sphere is bigger than the other, it is possible that one sphere is inside the other, but I leave the formulation out for this for now.</p>
    <p>Our intersecting point c_is defined as c_1 + h * (c_2 - c_1). (where h is some constant). Now we express r_1 and r_2 in terms of r_i, h and d using Pythagorean Theorem (we find the triangle that the intersection makes here), then solve the system of equations:</p>
    <p>(h<em>d)² + r_i² = r_i² | ((1-h)</em>d²) + r_i² = r_2² h² * d² - r_1² = -r_i² | (1 - 2<em>h + h²) </em> d² - r_2² = -r_i²</p>
    <p>which gives us h = 1/2 + (r_1 * r_1 - r_2 * r_2)/(2 * d*d)</p>
    <p>Subbing this back into our earlier formula for c_i gives us the center of the circle of intersection. Then we can find the radius of the intersecting circle by r_i = sqrt(r_1<em>r_1 - h</em>h<em>d</em>d).</p>
    <p>Now we use this radius and center to get our full circle of solutions, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the separating axis. We can take n_i = (c_2 - c_1)/d as the normal to this plane, and then further locate a point on this circle by choosing a tangent and bitangent perpendicular to this normal.</p>
    <p>p_i(theta) = c_i + r_i * (t_i * cos(theta) + b_i sin(theta))</p>
