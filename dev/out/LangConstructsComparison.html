    <p>I am, usually, working in different languages during a normal workday. And despite programming for some time now, every day I forget how to do a simple thing.</p>
    <p>It's quite annoying.</p>
    <p>I will try and summarise the common constructs that trip me up, because they are similar enough across most languages, but different enough that they don't compile, or cause unexpected problems.</p>

    <p>Objects are not necessarily instances of classes across languages. In JS, they are also the fundamental variable/entity, and are equivilant to dictionaries, hashmaps. In Python? In C++, they are an instance of a class, a variable.</p>
