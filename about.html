    <h1> SHIRGHO </h1>

    <section id="start">
      <p>Shirgho is an idea. An idea, that despite your level of proficiency, if you 
        grasp the essence of the moment, you might just achieve what you had set out to do.
        You are welcome to try it.
      </p>

      <p>It arose from one day when my friends and I were playing football in F9 Park. (One fine Ramadan day
        after the 2008 earthquake, which had damaged the school building, which was not good, obviously, 
        but meant that we had gotten almost three weeks of extra vacations leading up to Eid,  if I remember correctly.) 
      </p>

      <p> 
        We weren't great at football back then. I think we had just started playing.
        Anyway, we were up against some Pakhtun men, older than us, and stream-rolling us
        over. The were communicating in Pushto, making it harder for us to follow their plans,
        while we were desperately trying to join together any semblance of attack. Finally, 
        pissed off after the fifth or sixth straight goal conceded, and somehow magically all together,
        we started yammering out the word "shirgho", or something along the lines of it, as if chanting out a mantra,
        or talking in tongues. (Or now that I think about it, 20 years later, perhaps just making up a 
        fake pashto word and acting childishly racistly (but we were just like 10 or 12 years old at the 
        time, in our defence)). 
      </p>

      <p>Somehow though, our continous chanting of "Shirgho" as we gathered ourselves and finally started scoring
        some goals of our own shook our opposition to their cores.  Shirgho shirgho shirgho, I said, asking for a 
        pass with great urgency. Shirgho shirgho shirgho, he said, urging another friend to go for a shoot. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Maybe it was the fact that the chant united us up, focused our efforts. Maybe it just threw our opponents off.
        Maybe it saddened them to see such young kids succumb to racism. I dunno, but it ended with us winning the game.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        Since then, we took up the mantle of shirgho. Or at least, I took it up literally, as a name.
