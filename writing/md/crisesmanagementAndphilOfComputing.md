# Motivation

I am actually, super motivated to have the honour of working at HLRS, and on such an interesting topic as "Crisis Management".

This is because of its wide areas of focus, from gathering informatin to simulating scenarios, and of coming up with ways to mitigate human, animal and planteray suffering in a way that can help translate from the theoretical to the concrete physical world.

Even though I do not have a masters degree, I nevertheless want, nay, need to do a phd here. Is this at all possible at HLRS and Uni Stuttgart? I would love to sit down and really approach this problem from the ground up. I want to read all the current and previous literature, to learn previous methods of simulation and analysis, and then spend the time this problem deserves to come up with multiple solutions that can be applied in different scenarios.

I think there is a also a personal element of motivation here. I am originally from Pakistan, which is currently inundated with floods, largely due to the current fucking up of our climate. I want to extend the crises management from pandemic and disease handling, to other societal crises brought about by natural disasters. Even if not in the context of the DECICE project, then perhaps as a linked but separate, continuation of our research here.

And then, further onwards, I would absolutely love to contribute and be a part of the Philosophy of Computational Sciences at HLRS as well as the SANE group. To be able to have the opportunity to work and further develop my theoretical grounding in computer science and artificial intelligence, while at the same time give my mind officially alloted time to think about the conceptual problems at the intersection of CS, the tech industry and its products, and our society, is a dream. Even though I have no qualifications to prove it, this is where I believe I should end up eventually, and make my contribution to shaping the way we think about this intersection in the future.

I ask you this out of an earnestness, which is kind of embarresing. But I feel that I am more useful to the world, and to science, by spending at least the next 5 years and research. Even though my topic of work at Bosch would be interesting (Modelling and Code generation, I love basically anything to do with code), and even though I cannot turn my nose so easily away from the generous financial compensation they offer, I would not be happy there, I think. 

I think probably for large stretches of time I won't be happy at HLRS either, but that will be because of my ineptitude of finding good solutions, until hopefelly, finally, due to improving myself and my abilities, and with the expereinced guidance of my teams and mentors, I am sure I/we, will suceed in the end.
