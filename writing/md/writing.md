<section id="Problem">
    
<pre> <h4> The Problem with Us.
26-10-2022 </h4> </pre>

A bit of an over-sprawling article, which can probably be divided into two separate topics.
    
But for now, can read it <a href="theProblemWithUs.html">here.</a></p>

</section>

<section id="Uncle">
    
<pre> <h4> Adding link to Article on Uncle.
19-10-2022 </h4> </pre>

Had written it some time before, but did not know if it would be okay to publish it online.
But khair hai, I think. 
    
Can read it <a href="uncle.html">here.</a></p>

<section id="TheHeightofInhospitability">

<pre> <h4> The Height of Inhospitability
01-04-2022 </h4> </pre>

My first published story, selected as part of a competition at Typishly, where you had to use a given sentence as the first sentence of your story. 

I mean, it's not a literary masterpiece, but I don't know many literary master pieces from the perspectives of a horse. 

Read it [here](https://typishly.com/2019/06/27/the-height-of-inhospitality/ "inhospitability").

<section id="A KINGDOM FOR A KING, A KING FOR A KINGDOM">

<pre> <h4> A Kingdom for a King, a King for a Kingdom
01-04-2022 </h4> </pre>

My second published story, a short short story, selected for the 42 word stories anthology. Technically, it is still to be published, but I think the anthology comes out this year. 

Read it [here](kingdom.html "kingdom").
