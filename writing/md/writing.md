<pre> <h4> The Height of Inhospitability
01-04-2023 </h4> </pre>

My first published story, selected as part of a competition at Typishly, where you had to use a given sentence as the first sentence of your story. 

I mean, it's not a literary masterpiece, but I don't know many literary master pieces from the perspectives of a horse. 

Read it [here](https://typishly.com/2019/06/27/the-height-of-inhospitality/ "inhospitability").

My second published story, a short short story, selected for the 42 word stories anthology. Technically, it is still to be published, but I think the anthology comes out this year. 

Read it [here](kingdom.html "kingdom").
