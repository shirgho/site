# Quantum Physics

## Overview

A place to jot down and organise my notes on the basics, the different theories and how quantum computers are/could work.

## Waves and Particles

The wave function defines the properties of the particle, or it collapses to define the property of a particle when observed/measured.

So a particle comes out of its wave, in a way, which is why there is the wave-particle theory.

## Copenhagen (bohr and heisenberg)

## Plate theory (bohm)

## hidden variables (bell)
