[Aferthought to God]:
Also you are not a very good God in general, even though you have been good to me. What about the rest of the world and the suffering? At least save your muslim Quam. or is it up to me? Are you leaving saving the world up to me and my friends? You're a lazy God then. Or you are a God that does not want to step into this simulation and interfere. You want to see how we end up perhaps, even though you know how we'll end up? You're a confusing God. But thanks anyway, I guess.

[Apologetic aferthought to God]:
I am sorry for lashing out at you. I cannot understand what you are, obviously, and I am not meant to. Probably everything is a reflection of what is going on inside us. So all this suffereing, these floods, all the bullshit Snapchat, TikTok shit, they are actually my/our fault. If everyone in their hearts actually wanted things to be better, they would be. Either through some causal, phyisical, logical way, in which everyone just does better because they want things to be better, or in some kind of weird spiritual way that links into the material world and how we behave. Or both. 

I like to think that both work together, somehow.
