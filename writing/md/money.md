# Is everything for money?

Not everything, I think. And even if it is, you can have things for money and for something else as well.

News is to make money, as well as the original purpose, to inform.

Vaccines are to make money, as well as their original purpose, to protect.

Cars, for money, and for convenience.

Everything right, is basically a product, fulfilling some purpose for some amount of money.

The farmer spending the whole day looking after crops, yes, he does it so you can get the food in the end, but for money, not just or because of the kindness of his heart.
He has to feed his family as well. He can do it with the kindness of his heart as well as for money.

So what is wrong for working for money?

Should we be working out of the kindness of our hearts, or for some compensation?

Obviously, for compensation. I guess the question is, how much is fair compensation?

And the other question is, is the money distracting the original purpose of the person or thing or product?

For example, the News. Is the flow of money, the direction of clicks and likes, do they influence the news we are shown?

Is the news concerned with portraying the world as it is? Or does it emphasis the bad, the unconscious, and attempts to get us addicted to it, for money, in the end?
