    <h1 id="on-identity">On Identity</h1>
    <p>Which identity?</p>
    <p>Personal identity?</p>
    <p>National identity?</p>
    <p>Religious identity?</p>
    <p>Political identity?</p>
    <p>All ruses, to cover our real identity?</p>
    <p>which is to say, we have no identity. No real identity.</p>
    <p>All these identities are created by us, to provide us with cover, to hide away our actual nothingness.</p>
    <p>If I truly believe that, then why was it so hard for me to give up my Pakistani nationality?</p>
    <p>Well, it was more anger at the concept of nationality, first of all. The fact that I have to &quot;renounce&quot; it, to take up another not real identity. Just the fact that we are stuck in these papers and writings to describe who we are... to limit and mark us.</p>
    <p>With the green passport, they looked at me with fear, like I was a criminal, and let me pass. With the red, they roll their eyes at my brown skin and let me pass. I dunno what's better lol. Thankfully, I didn't care either way. It's basically an opportunity to observe human nature, as everything is for me.</p>
    <p>Secondly, it was because of my attachment to Pakistan as a place, as a home, to its ordinary people who are kind and good, and too all the great and not so great times I had as it shaped me up. By renouncing nationality, it seemed like they were asking me to forget that part of my life. But they weren't. I made the final decision. And it was just the guilt in me, somehow, which thought I was doing it. Like I was getting rid of something which helped me get something better. I was paying too much attention to the paper, and to the bullshit talking of friends and people. Somehow, I always let the opinions of other's affect me, even when I know it makes no sense for my mental peace.</p>
