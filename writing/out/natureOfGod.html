    <p>So, obviously, I cannot prove or disprove God. Obviously, I have no knowledge of what actually exisits and doesn't- I don't know who made the universe. I don't know what will happen to the universe.</p>
    <p>I do not know of our part in the entirity of the universe. I don't know where we fit in, and how and why.</p>
    <p>But does it change how I interact with the world.</p>
    <p>The I here, for now, is not any spiritual, metaphyisical I.</p>
    <p>It is the common I in common language.</p>
    <p>Like when you say, how are you doing? I would say, I am fine.</p>
    <p>That I.</p>
    <p>It refers to me as a person, as a body, as a mind, as everything. If there is a soul, it refers to that as well.</p>
    <p>Just refers to an encapsulation of a personal I.</p>
    <p>The question is, knowing or not knowing if God exists, if the universe has a higher purpose, if the people on this earth are ultimately guided by a higher consciousness, if I am not certain about this, does it change how I interact with this world?</p>
    <p>Well, initially, it doesn't. Because I am already not sure of anything, so I can't take anything for certain.</p>
    <p>So the initial answer is no, I continue interacting with the world as I do so now.</p>
    <p>And how is that? It's a fluctuation between considering myself a part of this world, and considering myself isolated and the world, or certain parts of it, something I have to defend myself against.</p>
    <p>“At all costs, the Christian must convince the heathen and the atheist that God exists, in order to save his soul. At all costs, the atheist must convince the Christian that the belief in God is but a childish and primitive superstition, doing enormous harm to the cause of true social progress. And so they battle and storm and bang away at each other. Meanwhile, the Taoist Sage sits quietly by the stream, perhaps with a book of poems, a cup of wine, and some painting materials, enjoying the Tao to his hearts content, without ever worrying whether or not Tao exists. The Sage has no need to affirm the Tao; he is far too busy enjoying it!” —from The Tao is Silent</p>
